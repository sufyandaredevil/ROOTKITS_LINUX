In the context of the Linux kernel package, make olddefconfig is a make target used to update the kernel configuration file (.config) when transitioning to a new kernel version. It is part of the Linux kernel build system and is used during the kernel build process to handle changes in the configuration options between different kernel versions.

When a new version of the Linux kernel is released, it may introduce new configuration options or modify existing ones. These configuration options control various features, drivers, and settings in the kernel. When you upgrade to a new kernel version, you need to update your existing kernel configuration to include the new options and reflect any changes.

The make olddefconfig target simplifies this process by automatically setting any new configuration options to their default values while preserving the settings of existing options that are present in your old configuration file.

Here's how you typically use make olddefconfig:

Go to the Linux kernel source directory (usually located in /usr/src/linux or a similar location).

Copy your existing configuration file (.config) from the old kernel to the source directory of the new kernel.

Run the following command to update the configuration:

go
Copy code
make olddefconfig
The command will prompt you to configure any new options that were added in the new kernel version. For each new option, you can choose to keep the default value, select a new value, or leave it as is (using the old configuration setting).

Once the process is complete, your configuration file will be updated to match the new kernel version.

Using make olddefconfig is a recommended step when upgrading to a new kernel version to ensure that your existing configuration settings are compatible with the new kernel and to take advantage of any new features or improvements introduced in the update.

Please note that make olddefconfig is just one of the many configuration-related make targets available in the Linux kernel build system. Other targets include menuconfig, xconfig, defconfig, and localmodconfig, among others, which provide different ways to configure the kernel options during the build process.
