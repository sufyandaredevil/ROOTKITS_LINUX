If you comment out the **GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT** and **GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET** options in the **/etc/default/grub** file, the behavior of the GRUB menu during boot will change as follows:

**GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT**: Without the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT option, the GRUB menu will be visible during the boot process, and it will remain displayed for the default timeout duration (usually 5 seconds) specified by the GRUB_TIMEOUT option (if it is set).
The user can interact with the GRUB menu during this time, selecting different boot options or accessing the command line interface.

**GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET**: Without the GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT_QUIET option, the GRUB menu will display a countdown message during the boot process, indicating the time remaining for the menu to be visible.
The countdown message allows the user to know that the GRUB menu is available and that they have a limited time to interact with it before the default boot option is automatically selected.
