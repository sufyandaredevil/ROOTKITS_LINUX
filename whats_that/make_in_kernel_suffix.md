**-j4**: The -j option is used to specify the number of parallel jobs or threads that Make should use for building. In this case, j4 means that the build process will utilize up to four parallel jobs, which can significantly speed up the kernel build process on systems with multiple cores or processors.

**deb-pkg**: This is a Make target specific to the Linux kernel source code. The deb-pkg target instructs Make to build Debian binary packages of the kernel.

**LOCALVERSION=-rootkit**: This is an assignment to the LOCALVERSION variable used in the kernel build. The LOCALVERSION variable allows you to append a custom string to the kernel version number, which can be useful for distinguishing custom-built kernels from official kernel releases. In this case, the value -rootkit is assigned to LOCALVERSION, indicating that the kernel being built will have the rootkit identifier in its version number.
